# TT-PLESS-SoC

**TT-PLESS-SoC** is a **processor-less System-on-Chip** fully generated through **[FlexSoC](https://github.com/EneaDim/flexsoc)** ‚Äî  
an open-source framework for **digital IP development and SoC integration**, built on **OpenTitan primitives**, **Yosys**, and **OpenROAD Flow Scripts (ORFS)**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**TT-PLESS-SoC** demonstrates a complete SoC architecture without a processor.  
All on-chip peripherals are controlled and monitored through **UART**, which acts as the external host interface.

### Integrated Peripherals
- **UART** ‚Äî system host interface  
- **4x GPIO** ‚Äî general-purpose I/O (4 bidirectional)  
- **1x PWM** ‚Äî pulse-width modulation generators  
- **Timer** ‚Äî RISC-V‚Äìstyle timer block  

All IPs are connected via a **TL-UL (TileLink Uncached Lightweight)** interconnect generated using **OpenTitan bus infrastructure**.

## üß† Architecture Concept

This SoC does **not** contain a CPU.  
Instead, the **UART** serves as the main control and communication bridge between the external host and the on-chip peripherals:

1. UART receives serialized commands from the host.  
2. FlexSoC‚Äôs TL-UL interconnect routes read/write transactions to the correct IP.  
3. Peripheral CSRs execute the command or return the data.  

This makes it possible to configure, test, and monitor every peripheral directly over UART.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration

- **System Clock:** 50 MHz  
- **Reset:** Active-low (`rst_n`)  
- **UART Baud Rate:** ~115,200 baud (8N1)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> When updating the UART control register, always keep bits **[31:16] = `0x0970`**.  
> These define the baud-rate divider for 115.2 kbaud at 50 MHz.

## üó∫Ô∏è Memory Map

| Peripheral | Base Address |
|-------------|--------------|
| UART        | `0x8000_0000` |
| PWM         | `0x8002_0000` |
| GPIO        | `0x8004_0000` |
| TIMER       | `0x8006_0000` |

Each IP has a detailed CSR description under the **`ips_docs/`** folder, automatically generated by **FlexSoC**.

## üîå External Interface

- **UART RX/TX** ‚Äî host communication for register access  
- **4x GPIO** ‚Äî bidirectional I/O pins  
- **1x PWM outputs** ‚Äî duty and period controlled via CSRs  
- **Clock input:** 50 MHz  
- **Reset input:** active-low asynchronous  
- **Enable signal (`ena`):** activates SoC outputs (safe state when low)

All communication and configuration occur through **UART**, enabling full SoC control from a PC or external controller.

## üß© About FlexSoC

**FlexSoC** is an **open-source environment for IP development and SoC integration**,  
built on **OpenTitan** and **lowRISC** design principles.  
It automates everything from **IP creation to full SoC assembly** and **physical implementation**, combining:

- **OpenTitan TL-UL** interconnect and primitive components  
- **Yosys** for open-source synthesis  
- **OpenROAD Flow Scripts (ORFS)** for place & route and GDSII generation  

FlexSoC provides:
- Automatic CSR and documentation generation  
- Automated TL-UL or PULP-style register interfaces  
- Linting, simulation (SystemVerilog & Cocotb), and synthesis analysis  
- Full RTL-to-GDS flow using only open-source tools  

In short: **FlexSoC lets designers focus on IP functionality**, while it handles integration, tooling, and flow automation.

## üî¨ Using the SoC

1. **Startup**
   - Apply 50 MHz clock and deassert reset.  
   - Open UART connection at **115,200 baud** (8N1).
   - To driver uart\_rx use ui\_in[0] pin.
   - To read data from the Soc use uart\_tx which is connected to uo\_out[0] pin.

2. **Control**
   - Write and read CSRs via UART to configure GPIOs, PWM, and Timer.  

3. **Example Operations**
   - Toggle GPIO pins by writing to output registers.  
   - Configure PWM frequency and duty cycle.  
   - Read timer registers to verify clock operation.
